# Generative Engine Optimization Proof of Concept

This is a simple proof of concept to analyze how enterprise websites are ranking on OpenAI's LLMs. It works in a couple of steps: 

1) Fetch information about the input company to understand more about the business.
2) Generate a list of questions about the business that a prospective customer may ask.
3) Use a variety of tools to mimic a standard ChatGPT interaction when answering these questions.
4) Analyze and score the responses given by the LLM to give the business owner an idea of how well their company ranks on LLMs.
